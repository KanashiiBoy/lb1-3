You see me trying to smile up on this pole
But I'm just hiding the pain that's deep in my soul
You wanna fuck me
And I already know
You wanna fuck me and toss me back on the floor

Simon, my brother, said 'i loved her'
Should I say that he loved me
I was in second grade, he was fourteen
In the shady of the trees
There was a summer breeze
Whole thing's a blurry dream
Behind the house quiet as a mouse
He told me not to even breathe
A secret hard to keep
I didn't know till thirteen
By then I knew what to do
Just an old routine
All the boys had a thing for me
You see me trying to smile up on this pole
But I'm just hiding the pain that's deep in my soul
You wanna fuck me
And I already know
You wanna fuck me and toss me back on the floor

My mama always said 'you're the brightest star'
In life, you're sure to go so far
Been at this club about four years
Hooked on dope, crying in the mirror
When we were just little girls
We learned to dance in mama's pearls
Baby bend over and shake that ass
Hey, you wanna come home with me
Hoping you fall in love with me
I could make love to you for free
We could just get a place and start a life
And try to make things right.

You see me trying to smile up on this pole
But I'm just hiding the pain that's deep in my soul
You wanna fuck me
And I already know
You wanna fuck me and toss me back on the floor
